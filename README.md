# Data sets for scheduling problems

This repository contains data sets and constraint models for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) and some variants.
Check out the [https://ptal.github.io/benchmarking.html](https://ptal.github.io/absolute/benchmarking.html) to benchmark on these data sets.

## Models

1. `rcpsp-cumulative.mzn`: Model in MiniZinc for the RCPSP/max using cumulative global constraints.
2. Project [kobe.rcpsp](https://github.com/ptal/kobe) can generate MiniZinc decomposition of RCPSP/max (without cumulative).

## Data sets

Please consult [this book](https://ptal.github.io/scheduling-data.html) for a description of the data sets, and credits to their owners.
